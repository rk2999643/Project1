    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with the nmber of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your
        choice will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is
        repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is agoal state; if
        you didn't, it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leave, though it may be that
        the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to agood leaf. At each node, beginning of the root, you choose one of its
        children to move to, and you keep this until you get to a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>Suppose you get to abad leaf. You can bactrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice,
        and trying out the next option in the set of options. If you run out of option, revoke the choice that got you here, and try
        another choice at the node. If you end up atthe root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.
    </p>
    <p>This needs an example</p>
    
    <img src="Image_root.png" width="300" height="200" alt="">

    <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root, your option are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your your option are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you are alreay tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to root.</li>
        <li>At root you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F, Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could
       make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we 
       have. (If we dohave an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)
    </p>

    <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>

    <font color="Blue">
    <pre>
        boolean solve(Node n){
            if n is aleaf node{
                if the leaf is the goal node, return true
                else return false
            }else{
                for each chid c of n{
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
               return false 
            }
        }
    </pre>
    </font>

    <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If
       solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from  the root to 
       some goal node. We save that n is solvable. if solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
    </p>

    <h3>How does this work?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>if any child of n is solvable. then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>if no child of n is solvable. then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hence to decide wheather any non-leaf nod en is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test wheather any 
        child of n is solvable. this is done recursively, on each child of n. in the above code, this is done by the lines </p>
    <font color="blue">
    <pre>
        for each child c of n{
            if solve(c) succeeds, return true 
        }
        return false 
    </pre>
    </font>
    <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out of a leaf node, if the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal 
        node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines 
    </p>
    
    <font color="blue">
    <pre>
        if n is a leaf node{
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
        }
    </pre>
    </font>

    <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><h2>To search a tree</h2></li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>If the tree consisits of a single leaf, test whether is a goal node.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have
            searched them all unsuccessfully.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h2>

    <p>Backtracking is rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm ca be rewritten as astack algorithm. In fact,
            that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.
    </p>

    <font color="blue">
    <pre>
        boolean solve(Node n){
            put node n on stack;
              while the stack is not empty{
                if the node at the top of the stack is leaf{
                    if it is a goal node, return true
                     else pop it off the stack
                }
                 else{
                    if the node at the top of the stack has untried children 
                     push the next untried child onto the stack 
                    else pop the node off the stack

            }
                return false 
        }
            
    </pre>
    </font>

    <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the 
        stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the node on stack at all times describe a valid path in the 
        tree. Nodes are remove from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,
        if the root node gets removed (making the satck empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the 
        problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack from (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal 
        node.

    </p>

    <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path infoemation is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of
       recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovred one node a time, by (for instance) printing the node 
       at the current level, on storing it in an array. 
    </p>

    <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:</p>

    <font color="blue">
    <pre>
        boolean solve(Node n){
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node {
                    print n 
                    return true
                }
                    else return false
            } else {
              for reach child c of n {
                if solve(c) succeeds {
                    print n 
                    return true
                }
              }
              return fasle  
            }
        }

    </pre>
    </font>

    <h2>Keeping backtracking simple</h2>

    <p> All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty
        cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:
    </p>

    <p>for example, if the path reprsents a series of moves in a cheese endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate
        solutions
    </p>

    <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could tests
       whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b> gameOver method</b> (or you could even call it <b>idLeaf</b> ). This method would encapsulate all the 
       ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain. 
    </p>

    <p>Notice that the backtracking algorithms reqire us to keep track, for each node o the current path, which of its children have 
       been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <b>for each child 
       c of n.</b> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out that the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through 
       them. In chess, for example, a node can reprsent one arrangement pf pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can 
       reprsent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track 
       of which one you've alreay exmined? 
    </p>

    <p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the
        node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, make it off the list. when 
        the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure." This simple approach, but it may require
        quite a lot of additional work.  
    </p>

    <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an 
       ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next. 
    </p>

    <p>For example, you might be able to number the <b> children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried 
       <b>child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1,</b> and you have not yet tried children <b>k+1</b> through <b>n.</b> Or if you
       are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try <b>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b> if child yellow fails,
       you know to try child green next. if you are searching a maze, you can try chices in the order left, straight,right <b> (or perhaps
       north, east, south, west). </b>
    </p>

    <p>it isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <b>In the chess game example,</b> you might number your
       pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each piece may also have several
       moves, and these must also be orderd.
    </p>

    <h2>Example tree search</h2>

    <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the
       simplest kind of tree a binary tree
    </p>

    <p> A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes One node is designated as the root node Each node can reference (point 
        to) zero one or two other nodes which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child.
        All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node and there are no cycles For our purposes, although this is not 
        part of the definition of a binary tree we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The 
        first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree
    </p>

    <p>Here's the defination of the BinaryTree class:</p>

    <font color="blue">

    <pre>
        public class BinaryTree{
           Binary Tree leftChild = null;
           BinaryTree rightChild = null;
           boolean isGoalNode =  false;
           String name;
        
        BinaryTree(String name Binary Tree left Binary Tree right boolean isGoalNode) {
         this.name = name;
         leftChild = left;
         rightChild = right;
         this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
        }    
    }
    </pre>
    </font>

    <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class and in it we will define a method make Treet() which constructs the above binary tree.
    </p>

    <font color="blue">

    <pre>static Binary Tree makeTree(){
          BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e,f;
          c = new Binary Tree ("C", null, null false);
          d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);
          e = new BinaryTree ("E", null, null, true);
          f = new BinaryTree ( "F", null, null, false);
          a = new BinaryTree ("A", c, d, false);
          b = new Binary Tree ("B", e, f, false);
          root = new binaryTree("Root",a b, false);
          return root;   
        }
    </pre>
    </font>

    <p>Here's a main program to a create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>

    <font color="blue">

    <pre>
        public static void main(string args[]){
            BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
            System.oout.print(solvable (tree));
        }    
    </pre>
    </font>
    <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>

    <font color="blue">

    <pre>
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
        
        /*1*/ if (node==null) return false;
        
        /*2*/ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;

        /*3*/ if(solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;

        /*4*/ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true; 

        /*5*/ return false;
        }
    </pre>
    </font>

    <p>Here's what the nubered lines are doing:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>if we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without
            first checking whether those children actually exist</li>

        <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li>
        
        <li>See if the left chld of none is sovable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We wil only get to this line if node is non null 
            and not a goal node, says to</li>

        <li>Do the same thing for the right child</li>
        
        <li>Since neither child of node in solvable, node it self is  not solvable</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true</p>

    <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An
       alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only they do. Here's that alternative versio</p>

    <font color="blue">

    <pre>
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
          
         if (node isGoalNode) return true;

         if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChid)) return true;
         if (node.rightChild != null && salvable(node.rightChid)) return true;
         return false;
    </pre>
    </font>
     
    <p>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>
    
    <h3>What are the children?</h3>

    <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous 
       choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the 
       right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without 
       recursion.</p>

    <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter 
       how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the 
       same color.</p> 
    
    <p>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are
       colored.</p>
    
    <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li>
        <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of 
            countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a 
       checkerboard only needs two colors.
    </p>

    <h3>boolean maplsOK()</h3>

    <p>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.</p>
    
    <h3>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</h3>
    <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.</p>

    <h3>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</h3>
    <p>Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard).</p>


    <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>

    <font color="blue">

    <pre>
        boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {

            if (row>= NUM_ROWS) return maplsOK();
            
            map[row][column] = color;

            for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {

              int[] next = nextRowAnd Column(row, column);

              if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;

             }

             return false;
        }
    </pre>
    </font>

    <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>

    <font color="blue">

    <pre>
        boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) {

            if (row>= NUM_ROWS)return true;
            
            if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {
            
             map[row][column] = color;
            
             for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++)
            
              int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column); 
              
              if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
            }
        }    
            
        return false;
     }

    </pre>
    </font>

    <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggest otherwise:</p>
     
    <table align="centre" border="1">
        <tr style="width: 100%">
            <th></th>
            <th bgcolor="silver">2 by 3 map</th>
            <th bgcolor="silver">3 by 3 map</th>
            <th bgcolor="silver">3 by 4 map</th>

        </tr>
        <tr>
           <td bgcolor="silver">Method 1:</td>
           <td>60 ms.</td>
           <td>940 ms.</td>
           <td>60530 ms.(1 minute)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td bgcolor="silver">Method 2:</td>
            <td>0 ms.</td>
            <td>0 ms.</td>
            <td>0 ms.</td>


        </tr>

    </table>
    <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure less than millisecond) Why this huge difference? Either of
       these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will
       often prevent exponential growth Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically
       guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children treduce the set of choices), do so
    </p>

    <h2>Debgging techniques</h2>

    <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall 
       back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of prim statements. These tricks can be 
       applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.
    </p>

    <h3>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</h3>

    <p>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones) You probabl 
       want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long 
       list of these, it's nerd to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
    </p>

    <h3>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</h3>

    <p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself 
       contain bugs or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.
    </p>

    <p>Here's our debugging pode. For this trivial program, there's almost more depugging code than actual code, but in larger programs 
       the proportions will be better

    <h3>Trick #3: Never discard yoyr debugging statements.</h3>

    <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug
       the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?
    </p>

    <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to 
       your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, 
       you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these 
       changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.</p>

    <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>
    
    <font color="blue">

    <pre>
        static final boolean debugging = false;

      static void enter(Binary Tree node) {

        if (debugging) {

           System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");

             indent indent + "| ";

           }
        }

      static boolean yes (BinaryTree node) {

       if (debugging) {

          indent = indent.substring(3);

          System.out.printin (indent + "solvable(" + name (node) + ") returns true");

       }
       return true;
     
      } 
      static boolean no(Binary Tree node) {

        if (debugging) {

         indent = indent.substring(3);

         System.out.printin (indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
        
        }
        return fasle;
     }      
    
    </pre>
    </font>

    <p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about 
       making your code larger, modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the
       controlled code will be discarded.
    </p>
    <h3>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h3>

    <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message 
       printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions. 
       However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following 
       code
    </p>

    <font color="blue">
        <pre>new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre>
    </font>
    <p>will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a 
       print statement.</p>

    <font color="blue">

    <pre>
        java.lang.Exception: Checkpoint Charlie

    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean, In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,
       which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.
    </p>

    <p>Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the 
       puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to 
       print out the bad news.
    </p>

    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,
       which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.
    </p>

    <p>Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board
       position, Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. 
       Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.</p>
    
    <p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of
       approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find
       a different but equally valid approach.
    </p>
    
    <p>First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique, if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump,
       it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and 
       check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require 
       having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the 
       board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.
    </p>

    <p>Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a 
       particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that 
       must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight 
       complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.
    </p>

    <h4>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each 
        space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int 
        position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:
    </h4>

    <ul>
        <li>f the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left;</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We write another method <b> int[] makeMove (int[] oldBoard, int position) </b> that will take a board and a position, make a move from 
       that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, 
       rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" 
       rather than "mutative."
    </p>

    <p>Along with <b>canMove and makeMove</b>, we are using methods <b>puzzleSolved and printBoard </b> with meanings that 
       should be obvious</p>

    <P>Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: Black start6s out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the least
       line. I've added line number to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Blacktracking always produces its
       results (sequance of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the result again it to get
       rhem in correct order.
